This is an unofficial Python API for Bamboo HR. So far it is focusing on managing employee information but you can pretty much do anything you want with a little python.

The library makes use of the [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) library for Python and [HTTPretty](https://github.com/gabrielfalcao/HTTPretty) for testing. A huge thank you to both of those excellent projects.

Using this library is very simple:

```python
from PyBambooHR import PyBambooHR

bamboo = PyBambooHR(subdomain='yoursub', api_key='yourapikeyhere')

employees = bamboo.get_employee_directory()
```

(Note that you have to enable sharing employee directory to use that method.)

This will give you a list of employees with properties on each including their ID.


```python
from PyBambooHR import PyBambooHR

bamboo = PyBambooHR(subdomain='yoursub', api_key='yourapikeyhere')

# Jim's employee ID is 123 and we are not specifying fields so this will get all of them.
jim = bamboo.get_employee(123)

# Pam's employee ID is 222 and we are specifying fields so this will get only the ones we request.
pam = bamboo.get_employee(222, ['city', 'workPhone', 'workEmail'])

```

Adding an employee

```python
from PyBambooHR import PyBambooHR

bamboo = PyBambooHR(subdomain='yoursub', api_key='yourapikeyhere')

# The firstName and lastName keys are required...
employee = {'firstName': 'Test', 'lastName': 'Person'}

result = bamboo.add_employee(employee)

The result dict will contain id and location. "id" is the numerical BambooHR employee ID. Location is a link to that employee.

```

Updating an employee

```python
from PyBambooHR import PyBambooHR

bamboo = PyBambooHR(subdomain='yoursub', api_key='yourapikeyhere')

# His name was test person...
employee = {'firstName': 'Another', 'lastName': 'Namenow'}

# Use the ID and then the dict with the new information
result = bamboo.update_employee(333, employee)

result will be True or False depending on if it succeeded.

```

Requesting a Report

```python
from PyBambooHR import PyBambooHR

bamboo = PyBambooHR(subdomain='yoursub', api_key='yourapikeyhere')

# Use the ID to request json information
result = bamboo.request_company_report(1, format='json', filter_duplicates=True)

# Now do stuff with your results (Will vary by report.)
for employee in result['employees']:
    print(employee)

# Use the ID and save a pdf:
result = bamboo.request_company_report(1, format='pdf', output_file='/tmp/report.pdf', filter_duplicates=True)

```
Getting information that is scheduled in the future
```python
from PyBambooHR import PyBambooHR

bamboo = PyBambooHR(subdomain='yoursub', api_key='yourapikeyhere', only_current=False)

```
BambooHR has effective dates for when promotions are scheduled to happen or when new hires are going to join the organization. In order to see these events before they happen using the BambooHR API set `only_current` to `False`. As a note, this only works for pulling reports and getting employee information. This does not work on getting the employee directory.
